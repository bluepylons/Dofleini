# Dofleini Controller

Dofleini is an STM32 controller with a USB-C connector, for the [Boston keyboard](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston). The idea was to move all SMT components into a separate daughterboard. It can also theoretically be used on other full-sized keyboards. It has a total of 29 I/O pins.

It is meant to fit in the F5-F8 on a keyboard with F-keys. 

The electrical schematic is copied off of the Acheron [Austin](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Austin).
