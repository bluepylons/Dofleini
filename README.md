# Dofleini Controller

Dofleini is an STM32 controller with a USB-C connector, for the [Boston keyboard](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston). The idea was to move all SMT components into a separate daughterboard. It can also theoretically be used on any keyboard with separated F-keys. It has a total of 29 I/O pins.

The electrical schematic is copied off of the Acheron [Austin](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Austin). 

The headers are on a 2.54mm (0.1") grid.
